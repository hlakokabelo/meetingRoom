## 🕯️ MeetingRoom

**MeetingRoom** is a discreet, ID-based chat system for conversations that don’t belong to timelines, feeds, or forever.

Create a room.
Share the meeting ID.
Speak freely.
Burn the room when it’s done.

It’s built for private circles, temporary identities, and quiet public forums—where rooms can exist for a moment or grow into gathering halls. No noise. No algorithms. Just people, words, and a door you can close.

### Core Ideas

* 🔑 **Join by Meeting ID** – only those with the key may enter
* 👤 **Temporary or saved profiles** – be a ghost or be remembered
* 📜 **Persistent room history** – new voices hear the old echoes
* 🔥 **Room owner can destroy the room** – erase it from existence
* 🌐 **Public rooms as forums** – private whispers or open debates

MeetingRoom is not a social network.
It’s a space between messages—
where conversations live, breathe, and disappear when they’re ready.
